Question 1:
a)
# in my SQL create a text file that uses the relevant database, select what columns you want to manipulate from which tables and
JOIN the two annotation gene / expression gene columns. Our condition using the WHERE command is that the values we will return
are < 1000

(query.sql)
USE compbiol
SELECT a.function, e.expr_value
FROM annotation LEFT JOIN expression AS e ON a.gene = e.gene
WHERE e.expr_value < 1000
ORDER BY expr_value;

# we then logout and go back into the shell. My specific machine needs sudo to use mySQL, we're using -B (Batch) to summon query.sql
because it will translate the mySQL data data into language the shell will understand (tabulator delimited lines). After using the
command we will get expression values below 1000. We will also order the expression values with ORDER BY.

sudo mysql -u root -p -B < query.sql
__________________________________________________________________
b)
#make another query, we only want to select from the annotation functions so select a.function, our condition is to return the inputs
WHERE they contain (LIKE) the "ase" string. Fairly straight forward. 

(query2.sql)
USE compbiol 
SELECT function
FROM annotation
WHERE function
LIKE '%ase%';

sudo mysql -u root -p -B < query2.sql
__________________________________________________________________
c)
#make another query, we are selecting all 3 columns to show up (gene, function, metabolism), but if we wanted to we could easily just
select gene for shorter outputs/less clutter. we are again searching in the annotation table our condition is that WHERE metabolism
matches a regular expression (REGEXP) Purine and Pyrimidine we will get those results printed out for us

(query3.sql)
USE compbiol
SELECT gene, function, metabolism
FROM annotation
WHERE metabolism
REGEXP '(Purine|Pyrimidine) biosynthesis';

sudo mysql -u root -p -B < query3.sql
