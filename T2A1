Question 1:
a)
# in my SQL create a text file that uses the relevant database, select what columns you want to manipulate from which tables and
JOIN the two annotation gene / expression gene columns. Our condition using the WHERE command is that the values we will return
are < 1000

(query.sql)
USE compbiol
SELECT a.function, e.expr_value
FROM annotation LEFT JOIN expression AS e ON a.gene = e.gene
WHERE e.expr_value < 1000
ORDER BY expr_value;

# we then logout and go back into the shell. My specific machine needs sudo to use mySQL, we're using -B (Batch) to summon query.sql
because it will translate the mySQL data data into language the shell will understand (tabulator delimited lines). After using the
command we will get expression values below 1000. We will also order the expression values with ORDER BY.

sudo mysql -u root -p -B < query.sql
__________________________________________________________________
b)
#make another query, we only want to select from the annotation functions so select a.function, our condition is to return the inputs
WHERE they contain (LIKE) the "ase" string. Fairly straight forward. 

(query2.sql)
USE compbiol 
SELECT function
FROM annotation
WHERE function
LIKE '%ase%';

sudo mysql -u root -p -B < query2.sql
__________________________________________________________________
c)
#make another query, we are selecting all 3 columns to show up (gene, function, metabolism), but if we wanted to we could easily just
select gene for shorter outputs/less clutter. we are again searching in the annotation table our condition is that WHERE metabolism
matches a regular expression (REGEXP) Purine and Pyrimidine we will get those results printed out for us

(query3.sql)
USE compbiol
SELECT gene, function, metabolism
FROM annotation
WHERE metabolism
REGEXP '(Purine|Pyrimidine) biosynthesis';

sudo mysql -u root -p -B < query3.sql

Question 2
a)
# follow the link, download the zip folder of world_x data. I personally saved it in the C: drive because this was the easiest way 
for me to complete the task. after I saved it in C i logged into the AWS instance; stabdard scp copy from C drive into the aws instance
I personally have to use sudo and -r otherwise i get permission denied. we're copying it into the /home/ubuntu drive in order to 

sudo scp -r /c/world_x-db/world_x.sql ubuntu@ec2-13-2-11-204-217.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com:/home/ubuntu

#then transfer it into mysql. same style as a standard login except we are importing it into the compbiol database (I didn't create 
a new one but you could), the < is necessary for importing, > is for exporting. I then wrote down the path it was importing from.

mysql -u root -p compbiol < /home/unbuntu/world_x.sql

b)
#after part a, i deconstructed the question into its recquired parts, it asked for the country, capital, english language and percentage
spoken above 50%. I aliased the country table c. and the countrylanguage as l. as they had all the necessary information. Although, my 
capital return was only the capital ID which would need to be linked up later on. I used country C as the baseline so i could join the 
two files on the only shared data, which was country ID (three letter symbol) as shown by the join command. I then ordered the results
by countries and createdthe condition WHEN they were speaking english AND WHEN that percentage was also returning > 0.5 value

SELECT c.country, c.capital, l.percentage, l.language
FROM [country] c
JOIN countrylanguage l ON c.code = l.countrycode
ORDER BY c.country
WHEN l.language = English
AND l.percentage > 0.50
